# IMF-Economic-Indicators

This repo contains data and code to extract and visualise and compare key economic indicators in developing markets - China and India. The purpose here is not a thorough dissertation on the two countries from an economic or a geo-political perspective. Rather a road-map and workflow is presented that allows for indicators that are relevant to the analyst to be selected and visulaised as required. 

## Data
Data is taken from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) dataset. For more than 50 years, the IMF has provided capacity development (technical assistance and training) on critical economic issues to central banks, finance ministries, tax authorities and other economic institutions.

This helps countries strengthen their economy and create more jobs. It also helps countries make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.

## Observvations
The purpose is to look at (pre-covid) how the economic policy and stated growth targets of the Indian governent has 'reduced the gap' to China as the world's largest developing economy. Contemporary estimates put India 10 - 15 behind China in its growth cycle and previous work has presented data on the key indicators making this apparent [1]. This project build upon this work and presents new analysis on the topic
