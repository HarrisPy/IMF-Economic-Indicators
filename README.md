# IMF-Economic-Indicators

This repo contains data and code to extract and visualise and compare key economic indicators in developing markets - China and India. The purpose here is not a thorough dissertation on the two countries from an economic or a geo-political perspective. Rather a road-map and workflow is presented that allows for the economic indicators that are relevant or interesting to an analyst to be selected and visulaised as required. As a 'reference standard' mean values for the G20 group of countries are included as part of the project.

The body of the work is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file.


## Data
Data is taken from the IMF's World Economic Outlook (WEO) dataset. For more than 50 years, the IMF has provided capacity development (technical assistance and training) on critical economic issues to central banks, finance ministries, tax authorities and other economic institutions.

This helps countries strengthen their economy and create more jobs. It also helps countries make progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
